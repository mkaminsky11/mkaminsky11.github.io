Our goal of our project was to find the corellation between weather patterns and air pollution. To do this, I bought a <a class="real-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, and attached an <a class="real-link" target="_blank" href="http://airpi.es/">AirPi</a> module. The code for the AirPi was written in Python, and I modified it to fit our needs (specifically, so that it recorded the data onto a file).  The Raspberry Pi was then launched via weather balloon to collect data. The project was ultimately successful, and advanced past the regional level to the state fair.</p>
