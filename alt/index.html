      Looks awesome!
      Personally I think this is amazing, and then some
      the best thing is: The interconnection between devices, which allows me to store code on the cloud efficiently
      Loving it, easy to use, and has everything i'd need for a long time
      Great featured code editor. I really like the a built in preview option. One of the best Google Drive add ons.
      Slick looking portfolio!

Our goal of our project was to find the corellation between weather patterns and air pollution. To do this, I bought a <a class="real-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, and attached an <a class="real-link" target="_blank" href="http://airpi.es/">AirPi</a> module. The code for the AirPi was written in Python, and I modified it to fit our needs (specifically, so that it recorded the data onto a file).  The Raspberry Pi was then launched via weather balloon to collect data. The project was ultimately successful, and advanced past the regional level to the state fair.</p>
